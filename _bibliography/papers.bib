  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

   abstract = {Carbon (13C) and oxygen (18O) isotopes in carbonates form clumped isotope species inversely correlated with temperature, providing a valuable paleothermometer for sedimentary carbonates and fossils. However, this signal resets (“reorders”) with increasing temperature after burial. Research on reordering kinetics has characterized reordering rates and hypothesized the effects of impurities and trapped water, but the atomistic mechanism remains obscure. This work studies carbonate-clumped isotope reordering in calcite via first-principles simulations. We developed an atomistic view of the isotope exchange reaction between carbonate pairs in calcite, discovering a preferred configuration and elucidating how Mg2+ substitution and Ca2+ vacancies lower the free energy of activation (ΔA‡) compared to pristine calcite. Regarding water-assisted isotopic exchange, the H+-O coordination distorts the transition state configuration and reduces ΔA‡. We proposed a water-mediated exchange mechanism showing the lowest ΔA‡ involving a reaction pathway with a hydroxylated four-coordinated carbon atom, confirming that internal water facilitates clumped isotope reordering. A molecular view of the oxygen isotope exchange informs the mechanisms behind the carbonate clumped isotope geothermometer.},

   abstract = {Stable chromium (Cr) isotopes (expressed in δ53Cr as the deviation of 53Cr/52Cr in samples from the international standard NIST SRM 979) are an emerging paleoredox proxy that has been used to track Earth's redox evolution over a range of timescales. There have been several major advances in our understanding of the Cr isotope system, but we are still developing a basic knowledge of the global Cr isotope mass balance and there are key Cr fluxes with poorly constrained isotopic compositions. The Cr isotope behavior in estuaries is one such poorly constrained aspect of the modern Cr cycle. Therefore, we collected water and suspended particulate samples from the estuary of the Connecticut River, and present the first Cr isotope dataset from a salinity gradient. As pH and salinity increases from brackish to salt water, dissolved Cr increases from 118.1 ± 25.7 ng/kg (1σ, n = 6) to 225.1 ± 26.0 ng/kg (1σ, n = 8), while particulate Cr decreases from 341.3 ± 319.8 ng/kg (1σ, n = 6) to 208.4 ± 364.5 ng/kg (1σ, n = 8); dissolved δ53Cr decreases from 1.30 ± 0.27‰ (1σ, n = 6) to 0.64 ± 0.16‰ (1σ, n = 8), whereas particulate δ53Cr remained stable at 0.11 ± 0.07‰ (1σ, n = 9). These data suggest that Cr is lost from particles to solution when transitioning from brackish to salt water in the Connecticut River estuary. If these observations can be confirmed in other estuaries, estuary systems can potentially enhance riverine dissolved Cr fluxes and thus lower the Cr oceanic residence time, which has important implications for the Cr isotope system as a paleoceanographic redox proxy. There is a clear inverse correlation between dissolved Cr and δ53Cr in the Connecticut River estuary, which yields a Cr isotope fractionation factor of ~0.89‰ that is indistinguishable from previous estimates based on open seawater samples. Large δ53Cr variation in oxygenated open and estuary seawater suggests that marine δ53Cr variations need not necessarily be exclusively tied to Cr(VI) reduction in low oxygen zones. Therefore, interpreting δ53Cr in the sedimentary record requires taking multiple processes into consideration.},
