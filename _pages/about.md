Howdy, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/geology-geophysics/index.html">Department of Geology and Geophysics, Texas A&M University</a> under supervison of [Dr. Ethan Grossman](https://artsci.tamu.edu/geology-geophysics/contact/profiles/ethan-grossman.html). My recent projects focus on the kinetics and atomistic mechanism of carbonate clumped isotope (âˆ†<sub>47</sub>) bond reordering, and applications in basin thermal history and paleoclimate reconstruction based on experiments and physical-chemical modeling. Future research interests include: (1)Mesozoic terrestrial climate; (2)early Ordovician climate and seawater Î´18O; (3)potential applications of organic clumped isotopologues in the reconstruction of paleoclimate and reaction pathways.
