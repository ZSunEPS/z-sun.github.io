I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Geology and Geophysics, Texas A&M University. My research interests are the kinetics and atomistic mechanism of carbonate clumped isotope (âˆ†<sub>47</sub>) bond reordering, reconstruction of basin thermal history and evolution of paleoclimate. Approaches in my projects involve both experimental work and physical-chemical modeling. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
