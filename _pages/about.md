Howdy, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. at <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/geology-geophysics/index.html">Department of Geology and Geophysics, Texas A&M University</a> working with [Dr. Ethan Grossman](https://artsci.tamu.edu/geology-geophysics/contact/profiles/ethan-grossman.html). My recent projects focus on the kinetics and atomistic mechanism of carbonate clumped isotope (âˆ†<sub>47</sub>) bond reordering, and applications in basin thermal history and paleoclimate reconstructions based on experiments and physical-chemical modeling. 

As a geochemist, I am deeply interested in a range of scientific disciplines, including clumped isotopes, paleoclimate, mass extinctions, terrestrial environments, and carbonate preservation and diagenesis. My long-term research goal is to examine geochemical proxies and the co-evolution of environment and ecology throughout Earthâ€™s history.
