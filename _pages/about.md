I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Geology and Geophysics, Texas A&M University under supervison of [Dr. Ethan Grossman](https://geogeo.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/grossmanethan.html). My research interests are the kinetics and atomistic mechanism of carbonate clumped isotope (âˆ†<sub>47</sub>) bond reordering, reconstruction of basin thermal history and evolution of paleoclimate. Approaches in my projects involve both experimental work and physical-chemical modeling.
